.. glossary::

    Autopost from external source
      This feature allows you to select a RSS feed and automatically sends its content to your users as soon as the source updates. You can configure the target and the distribution method for each source.

    Trigger campaigns
      In 10darts you can set up campaigns that will be sent when the user behaves in pre-determined manner, i.e.: accesses for the first time, has not accessed in certain number of days, becomes a heavy user, etc. Each of these events is a trigger campaign that affects one user at time based on a trigger event. For Facebook Messenger you can design a conversational flow and adding Quick Reply buttons you can easily qualify each user into a specific segment automatically saving and storing their responses.

    Autonomous A/B Testing
        Once you've set up the A/B testing messages, why waste your time waiting on the results to take an action 10darts autonomously identifies and expands on the fly the most relevant message for your users.

    Autonomous Segmentation
        Using AI, 10darts' clusters and segments your user base to maximize their engagement with customized push notifications.

    Smart distribution: Geo Ripple-Effect Â®
        10darts' Geo-Ripple algorithms autonomously expand your push notifications throughout your user base creating a cascade effect that maximizes the interested audience of your notifications. This algorithm is especially useful when you manage and produce local relevant information, from job vacancies in local businesses to local news.

    Content Relevance
        10darts uses content relevance score calculations to autonomously determine the relevant audience of a specific content out of your entire user base.
