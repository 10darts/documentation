Authentication with a Token
---------------------------

You will have a random text string credential generated by the system. This string or ``token``,
will be used for the API calls authentication.

The token must be included in the **Authorization** HTTP header. The key must include
the word ``Token`` before with a space. For example:

    Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b

You can also use the specific application token, generated for each application you create
in 10darts. In this case, the header value has to begin with the word ``AppToken``. For example:

    Authorization: AppToken 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b

No authenticated calls will be answered with a ``HTTPÂ 401 Unauthorized``.
