Segments
========

Through the Campaign Manager on the dashboard you can set up the user
targets more commonly used in your marketing strategy. These `segments <https://10darts.com/app/segments/create>`_
can be used when you create manual campaigns as well as the campaigns
handled by the API and when you configure a Content Feed.

By default, 10darts comes with `some predefined segments <https://10darts.com/app/segments>`_ based on
behavioral criteria:

.. glossary::

    Rookies
        Users who has interacted for the first time and only once, in the last 14 days.

    Looky-Loos
        Rookies who have not come back in the last 14 days.

    Stars
        Users who has interacted for the 2nd (or more) times in the last 14 days.

    Sleepers
        Stars who have not interacted in the last 14 days.

    Zombies
        Any user who has not interacted in more than 14 days.

You can modify the 14 days period in `Settings <https://10darts.com/app/settings>`_.

You might find 10darts suggests you use other user segments to
enhance your user engagement.
