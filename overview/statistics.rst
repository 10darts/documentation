=========

10darts provides you with a default set of reports so you know at all
moments and in real time the performance level of your push notifications
and your users’ engagement.


`Overview <https://10darts.com/app/dashboard>`_
-----------------------------------------------

At the top of your Dashboard you will find the following key performance
indicators:

.. glossary::

    Total Users
        Total number of users you’ve had since you started with 10darts.

    Alive Users
        Users who have not churned.

    Push-On Users
        Live users who accept your push notifications.

    Active Users in Current Month
        Users who interacted during the current month

Then you’ll see the following charts:

Overall Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can first determine the time period you want to analyze and also
whether you want to see the results in days, weeks or months, when
appropriate.

In your first chart you’ll see the analysis of the overall performance of all
the push notifications you’ve sent to your users through 10darts, whether
through Manual Campaigns, Content Feed or API.

That performance is analyzed in terms of number of push notifications you
have sent, those received by your users, as confirmed by 10darts, and
those your users opened.

Campaign Success Ratio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this chart you have information on the Success Ratio of your push
notifications, Manual Campaigns, Content Feed and API, measured as the
amount of push opened vs the amount of push received by your users.

You can see in the Total bars the total number of push notifications
opened by all your users vs the total number of received in all the push
notification categories you have (Manual Campaigns, Content Feed and
API) expressed in percentage.

`Cohorts <https://10darts.com/app/metrics/cohorts>`_
----------------------------------------------------

In Cohorts you can see the evolution of the users based on when they
were acquired. This will help you to analyze the impact of your acquisition
strategy in the timeline. You can analyze the information based on days,
weeks or months.

The rows shows the time line starting at the moment your users
downloaded your app (0) and the consecutive days, weeks or months (1 to
n) tell you the percentage of those alive in each given period.
