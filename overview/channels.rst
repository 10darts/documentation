Touchpoints
===========

We have defined a Touchpoint as each communication channel that you
have with each user. A user can have several Touchpoints with you, i.e.:
through your app on the mobile, on the tablet, web, and (in the near future)
Facebook messenger.

In order to achieve a maximum user engagement 10darts will help you
control and even manage for you, each Touchpoint for you. The goal is to allow
you to reach your customer where, when and how is most convenient for
them to maximize their engagement.
