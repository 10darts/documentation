.. glossary::

    Channel
        Different communication channels: app, web notification, FB messenger, iOS, Android, etc.

    Language
        10darts takes into account the user’s device language.

    App version
        Users with different app versions can also be targeted, related with iOS and Android apps.

    Users
        List of individual users you specifically want to target.

    Segment
        You can choose among those `you have already defined <https://10darts.com/app/segments>`_.

    Tags
        Keys or attributes you use for the different user categories you have in
        your CRM and that you previously have updated on 10darts. You can
        see how you can update your users’ categories using the API click :ref:`here <api>`
        and the SDK click :ref:`here <android-sdk-user-data>`
        or click :ref:`here <users-import>` to import a CVS File.

    Random Segmentation
        When you “Enable Sample Size of Recipients” 10darts selects the
        random number of users you specify within your user target to test the
        notification.

    Geographical Segmentation
        When you enable this option your campaign will be sent to users located in
        the geography that you define, either by name, i.e. country, state, city,
        neighborhood, or by drawing a circle or an area on the map.
