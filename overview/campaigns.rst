A Push Notification Campaign is the action of sending push messages to
part or all of the users that have your app installed and have allowed
the notifications from you.

There are 3 ways of generating campaigns:

1. `Manual Campaigns <https://10darts.com/app/notifications>`_ tool.
2. `Content Feed <https://10darts.com/app/notifications/automatic>`_ by generating automatic campaigns with a content RSS.
3. `API <https://10darts.com/app/notifications/transactional>`_.

In Manual Campaigns you can use the Campaign Manager to define user
targets, distribution methods and schedules.
