Android SDK Setup
=================

The following instructions will guide you through the process of
implementing 10 Darts SDK in your application, the instructions are
based on *Android Studio.*



.. note::
    Note that the target devices should have Google Play services installed
    and updated on it for the proper operation of this SDK

.. warning::

    Before proceeding you should have created a GCM project in your firebase
    console, please refer to :ref:`Google Cloud Messaging <faq-gcm>` and
    follow the steps.


Configure the application
-------------------------

1. Library
^^^^^^^^^^

Add the following line to your app build.gradle:

* In android section:

.. code::

        packagingOptions {
            pickFirst 'META-INF/*'
        }
         defaultConfig
            {
                manifestPlaceholders = [tendarts_sdk_access_token: "YOUR ACCESS TOKEN",
                                        tendarts_sdk_client_class:"YOUR CLIENT CLASS",
                                        gcm_sender_id: "YOUR GCM SENDER ID"]
            }

* In dependencies section:

.. code::

    compile  'com.10darts:sdk:1.18'




-  **tendarts\_sdk\_access\_token**: your access token to 10darts
-  **dtendarts\_sdk\_client\_class**: the full qualified name of your SDK
   implementation (see :ref:`Implementing client class <android-sdk-client>`)
-  **gcm\_sender\_id**: the sender id you copied in the last step
   of :ref:`Google Cloud Messaging <faq-gcm>`



.. _android-sdk-client:


2. Create a client class whose superclass is TendartsClient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /_static/images/client1.png
  :alt: Create class

  Create class

And implement the methods, default implementation itâ€™s ok for
starting but you should add your own functionality as needed.

.. figure:: /_static/images/client2.png
  :alt: Implement methods

  Implement methods

.. code:: java

   @Override
   public String mainActivityClassName()
   {
       return MainActivity.class.getName();
   }

Don't forget to add the full qualified name of this class to **tendarts_sdk_client_class** on the manifest placeholders



Add your custom functionality as needed, please refer to :ref:`Dartslient class documentation <android-sdk-classes-client>` for further documentation



3. Forward functions of your Main Activity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Forward onCreate:

.. code:: java


        TendartsSDK.onCreate(savedInstanceState, this, new TendartsSDK.ILocationAlerter()
       {
           @Override
           public void alertNotEnabled(Activity activity)
           {
             //See Adding Geolocation if you are using this feature otherwise leave empty function.
           }
       });


And onResume:

.. code-block:: java

    TendartsSDK.onResume(getApplicationContext());



.. warning::

    If you are targetting Android API level higher than 22 you showuld follow :ref:`Targetting Android API level >= 23 <android-target-api>`


.. note::

    See :ref:`Adding Geolocation <android-sdk-geolocation>` for increasing locattion accuracy and receiving location updates.


.. note::

    By default when a notification is clicked the contained deep link is launched, check :ref:`Deep linking <faq-deep-link>`
